We use data to decide how to break the houses into two groups, and then again to determine the predicted price in each group. This step of capturing patterns from data is called fitting or training the model. The data used to fit the model is called the training data.
The predicted price for the house is at the bottom of the tree. The point at the bottom where we make a prediction is called a leaf.
A DataFrame holds the type of data you might think of as a table. This is similar to a sheet in Excel, or a table in a SQL database.
